### Andy Swift

I grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts.

I've been a developer and graphic designer since 1989.

I'm currently the developer of [Svija][sv], working on a new vision of how to create web content.

I was born in Cambridge England, grew up in the U.S., and I've lived in France since 2000 (Landes then Toulouse).

In addition to my technical experience, I'm also a classical artist and bassist.

I've been very strongly influenced by Buddhist philosophy.

It took me a while to learn to work hard.

Two things I'm proud of:

From 2012-2014 I took a sabbatical to concentrate on classical art. The following drawing is
based on “Studio di panneggio di una figura seduta” by Leonardo da Vinci.

I drew it from an enlarged iPhone photo after handling <a href='https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl020003018'>the original</a> at the Louvre.

<i>n° 379, Figure Assise, 2013.</i> Charcoal, black and white Carbothello on brown Canson paper. 36,0 x 36,0 cm.

For 2004-2007, I presented more than 150 open stage nights in Seignosse and Hossegor.

It was the most fun I've ever had.

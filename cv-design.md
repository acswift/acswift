Svija is a website-building platform that enables users to create web content using Adobe Illustrator.

An Illustrator panel enables users to easily save pages as SVG files.

A macOS app runs in the background to sync website content between the user's computer and the web server.

A Django app on the server creates structured web content integrating the user's SVG files, and manages the site map, page titles, SEO content etc.

Django Admin was extensively customized to provide each user with a control panel for their website.

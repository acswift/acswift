Since 2019, I've been developing `Svija`, a way to build websites using Adobe Illustrator · [svija.com](https://svija.com).

From 2015-2019, I was an independent designer · [ozake.com](https://ozake.com).

From 2012-2014, I took a couple of years to concentrate on classical drawing · [portfolio](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewcarrollswift/albums)

#### What I'm Like

I'm a perfectionist, but perfection can mean doing something quickly and not well when it's called for.

I work well under pressure.

I work well in teams.

I am an expert in only a few domains, but I am really good at seeing the right target and mobilizing the resources to get there.

Think: getting to the right place by any means necessary, rather than using only tools in my comfort zone.

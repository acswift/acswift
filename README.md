### Andy Swift

I've been a developer and graphic designer since 1989.

I'm currently the CTO of [Svija][sv] â€” we're using Adobe Illustrator to create amazing web content that's just impossible by any other means.

Although I'm American, I was born in Cambridge Enlgand and I've lived in France since 2000 (les Landes then Toulouse).

In addition to my technical expertise, I'm also an accomplished classical draughtsman and bassist.

I've been very strongly influenced by Buddhist philosophy.

It took me a while to learn to work hard.
